Gemini CMD Automation
Gemini CMD Automation is a Python project that integrates Google's Gemini AI with automated Windows CMD (Command Prompt) execution. The goal is to allow users to run system commands using natural languageâ€”no need to memorize complex CMD syntax.

Project Features
Users can describe tasks in plain English without needing CMD knowledge.
Gemini AI converts natural language into valid CMD commands.
Commands are executed automatically using Python.
Output and errors are displayed directly to the user.
Simple, fast, and user-friendly.

How It Works
The user enters a plain-English description of a task they want to perform.
Gemini AI interprets the request and generates a suitable CMD command.
The generated command is executed automatically via the subprocess module.
The result or any error messages are shown to the user.

Technologies Used
Python
google-generativeai library for interacting with Gemini
subprocess module for executing system commands
