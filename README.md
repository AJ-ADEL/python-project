 Project Description:
This Python project integrates Google's Gemini AI with automated Windows CMD command execution.
The goal is to help users execute system commands without the need to memorize or know CMD commands, simply by using natural English language descriptions.

✅ Project Features:
Users can describe what they want in plain English without knowing CMD commands.

Gemini AI automatically converts the description into the correct CMD command.

The command is executed automatically and the result is displayed.

Easy, fast, and user-friendly.

💡 How It Works:
The user writes a description of the task they want to perform in CMD.

Gemini AI generates the appropriate CMD command without any extra explanation.

The command is automatically executed in CMD and the result or any errors are displayed.

💻 Example Use:
You can write:

"Show me my IP address"

or "List all files in this folder"

The AI will suggest commands like:

ipconfig

or dir

And the command will be executed automatically with the results shown instantly.

🛠 Technologies Used:
Python

google-generativeai library (for interacting with Gemini)

subprocess module for command execution

re module for accurate text extraction

🎯 Project Goal:
To provide a simple and intelligent assistant that allows users to interact with Windows systems without needing to memorize complex commands, with the possibility of future expansion to include additional features.

✅ If you'd like, I can also help you:

Choose a project name.

Write a short tagline.

Upload the project step by step on GitHub.
Just let me know!
