 Gemini CMD Automation

This Python project integrates **Google's Gemini AI** with automated **Windows CMD command execution**.  
The goal is to help users execute system commands without the need to memorize or know CMD commands, simply by using **natural English language descriptions**.


 Project Features

- Users can **describe what they want in plain English** without knowing CMD commands.
- **Gemini AI** automatically converts the description into the correct CMD command.
- The command is **executed automatically** and the result is displayed.
- Easy, fast, and user-friendly.


 How It Works

1. The user writes a description of the task they want to perform in CMD.
2. **Gemini AI** generates the appropriate CMD command without any extra explanation.
3. The command is automatically executed in CMD and the result or any errors are displayed.


 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **google-generativeai** library (for interacting with Gemini)
- **subprocess** module for command execution
- **re** module for accurate text extraction
